# Abstract

Handwritten text recognition remains a challenging task due to variations in writing styles, noise, 
and segmentation complexities. This report explores the application of Long Short-Term Memory 
(LSTM) networks for handwritten detection. We propose a system that leverages the sequential learning 
capabilities of LSTMs to effectively capture the temporal dependencies within handwritten characters and 
words. 
The report details the system architecture, encompassing pre-processing techniques for noise 
reduction and image preparation. We outline the LSTM network design, including the choice of 
hyperparameters and the training process. The Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function 
is employed to handle the inherent variability of handwritten text lengths. 
The report presents the evaluation methodology, including the chosen handwritten text dataset 
and performance metrics. We discuss the achieved accuracy of the system in detecting handwritten text 
and compare it to potential baseline approaches. 
Finally, the report concludes by summarizing the findings and potential areas for future 
exploration. We discuss the limitations of the current system and propose avenues for improvement, such 
as incorporating additional pre-processing steps or investigating advanced LSTM architectures.
